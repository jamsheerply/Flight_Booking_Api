# FLIGHT BOOKING API

## Project Overview

The Flight Booking API project is designed to allow users to search for flights, book tickets, and manage their bookings. It includes a robust user authentication system where users register and log in to obtain a JWT token, which is required for accessing flight search and booking functionalities. The application handles user authentication securely and validates JWT tokens for authorized access to various API endpoints.

Users can search for available flights by providing parameters such as departure, destination, and travel dates. Once a user books a flight, the confirmed booking details are stored, and they can retrieve their past bookings at any time. The project includes comprehensive error handling, secure endpoints, and a seamless flow from registration to booking and viewing past reservations, ensuring a complete and secure user experience.

## User Authentication

- **User Registration**: [Register User](https://jamsheer.life/api/v1/auth/register)
- **User Login**: [Login User](https://jamsheer.life/api/v1/auth/login)

**Instructions**:  
After logging in, you will receive a token. Copy the token and paste it in the "Authorization" tab of Postman. Select "Bearer Token" as the type, and paste the token. You can then run the following routes in Postman. The body elements for `search` and `book` should be sent as POST, while `bookings` is a GET request.
